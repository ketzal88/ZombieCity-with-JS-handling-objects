# ZombieCity with JS handling objects

In this project, I created a game using the object-oriented programming paradigm. In the game, our hero, the main player, has to reach the goal dodging different obstacles and avoiding being caught by zombies or the runaway train.

Thie idea of the project is to capture the essence of each object and what its responsibilities are. These should be carefully thought out, since it is not correct to mix disparate functionalities in the same object. The ‘zombie’ object knows how to “attack” but it would be wrong if it also knows how to display an alert button on the screen.
